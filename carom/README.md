CAROM is the machine learning tool described in the article ‘ **Metabolic signatures of regulation by phosphorylation and acetylation** ’ by Chandrasekaran, Lee, Shen and Smith. This tutorial requires basic knowledge of MATLAB and Python, while familiarity with flux balance analysis (FBA) is also helpful. The CAROM software code and the metabolic network models can be downloaded from the Files tab. Installation
